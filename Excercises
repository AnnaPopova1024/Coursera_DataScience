*Exercise 2: Aggregate Functions*
Query A1: Enter a function that calculates the total cost of all animal rescues in the PETRESCUE table.
  SELECT SUM(cost) FROM petrescue;
  
Query A2: Enter a function that displays the total cost of all animal rescues in the PETRESCUE table in a column called SUM_OF_COST.
  SELECT SUM(cost) AS Sum_of_Cost FROM petrescue;
  
Query A3: Enter a function that displays the maximum quantity of animals rescued.
  SELECT MAX(quantity) FROM petrescue;
  
Query A4: Enter a function that displays the average cost of animals rescued.
  SELECT AVG(cost) FROM petrescue;

Query A5: Enter a function that displays the average cost of rescuing a dog.
  SELECT AVG(cost/quantity) FROM petrescue WHERE animal = 'Dog';


Exercise 3: Scalar and String Functions
Query B1: Enter a function that displays the rounded cost of each rescue.
  SELECT ROUND(cost) FROM petrescue;
  
Query B2: Enter a function that displays the length of each animal name.
  SELECT animal, LENGTH(animal) FROM petrescue;
  ## Here I added also name of the animal for reference
  
Query B3: Enter a function that displays the animal name in each rescue in uppercase.
  SELECT UPPER(animal), UCASE(animal) FROM petrescue;
  ## Here are 2 ways to do it
  
Query B4: Enter a function that displays the animal name in each rescue in uppercase without duplications.
  SELECT DISTINCT UPPER(animal) FROM petrescue;
  ## DISTINCT does not require the parenthesis, the result will be the same with and without putting (animal) inside them  

Query B5: Enter a query that displays all the columns from the PETRESCUE table, where the animal(s) rescued are cats. Use cat in lower case in the query.
  SELECT id, lower(animal), quantity, cost, rescuedate FROM petrescue
  WHERE animal = 'Cat';

  ##Better version:
  SELECT * FROM petrescue
  WHERE lower(animal) = 'cat';

  select * from PETRESCUE where LCASE(ANIMAL) = 'cat';
  
  
Exercise 4: Date and Time Functions
Query C1: Enter a function that displays the day of the month when cats have been rescued.
  SELECT DAYOFMONTH(rescuedate) FROM petrescue WHERE animal = 'Cat';
  
Query C2: Enter a function that displays the number of rescues on the 5th month.
  SELECT SUM(quantity) FROM petrescue WHERE MONTH(rescuedate) = '05';

Query C3: Enter a function that displays the number of rescues on the 14th day of the month.
  SELECT SUM(quantity) FROM petrescue WHERE DAY(rescuedate) = '14';

Query C4: Animals rescued should see the vet within three days of arrivals. Enter a function that displays the third day from each rescue.
  SELECT rescuedate, (rescuedate + 3 DAYS) FROM petrescue;

Query C5: Enter a function that displays the length of time the animals have been rescued; the difference between todayâ€™s date and the rescue date.
  SELECT rescuedate, (CURRENT_DATE - rescuedate) FROM petrescue;
